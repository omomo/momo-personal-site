Excerpt: First post of website created using Pelican.

Hello World! I created this blog/website with the `Pelican` static site generator, using the beautiful `flasky` theme by [fjavieralba](http://fjavieralba.com/).

On this blog, I will not only express my (techncial _and_ non-technical) thoughts, but also document interesting concepts I come across while working with data.

I hope you will enjoy the content of this blog!
